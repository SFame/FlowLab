# FlowLab
# Visual Programming Platform

A node-based visual programming system for creating complex logic through simple drag-and-drop interactions.

## What is this?

This is a visual programming environment where you build programs by connecting nodes instead of writing code. Each node represents a function or operation, and connecting them creates the flow of data and logic.

Think of it like a flowchart that actually runs - you drag nodes onto a canvas, connect them with lines, and watch your logic execute in real-time.

## Why build this?

Traditional programming requires learning syntax, debugging cryptic error messages, and thinking in abstract text. This platform lets you:

- See your logic visually as you build it
- Test and modify programs instantly without compilation
- Focus on problem-solving rather than syntax
- Collaborate with non-programmers on logic design

## How it works

1. **Drag nodes** from a palette onto the workspace
2. **Connect nodes** by drawing lines between input and output ports
3. **Run your program** and see data flow through the connections in real-time
4. **Modify on the fly** - change connections or add nodes while it's running

## Built with

- Unity 6000.0.32f1
- C# with custom node framework
- IronPython integration for scripting
